Project : Heaps 


Assignment Overview


You will be building a fixed size min heap. Meaning, in the constructor for the Heap class there 
will be a capacity value entered and you cannot ever exceed the number of elements at that capacity level. 

 

Assignment Deliverables
Be sure to submit your project as a folder named "Project6" and include in the folder:

Heap.py, a Python3 file
Node Class is completed in the skeleton file.
It's definition includes a key and a value, where the key denotes the actual entity determining the ordering within the heap,
and the value represents the actual content of interest.
It also has been provided with less than, greater than and string representation methods.
Once a Node has been instantiated, the member variables should not be modified.
Finally, it has a single accessor method to obtain the value of the Node.

Heap Class is partially completed in the skeleton file. Function signatures or provided funtons may not be edited in anyway.
* __init__(self, capacity)
    self._size - number of nodes in tree
    self._data - built in list meant to contingiously store the nodes 
    self._capacity - enforced number of elements that can exist in the heap at any given time 

Complete and implement the following functions. Do not modify the function signatures

* _perc_up(self)
    - when an element exists in the last spot of the underlying data, perculate it up to it's 
    valid spot in the heap representation 
    - return None 
    - Time Complexity O(log(N))     
    - Space Complexity O(1)

* _perc_down(self)
    - when an element exists in the first spot of the underlying data, perculate it down to it's 
    valid spot in the heap representation 
    - return None 
    - Time Complexity O(log(N))     
    - Space Complexity O(1)

* _min_child(self, idx)
    - given an index of some root, return the index of which child is smallest
    - in the event that the index is a leaf node return -1
    - return : type int


* push( self, el):
    - adds new element into heap  
    - el will always be of type Node 
    - return None 
    - in the event that pushing will excede the limit, you must pop an element out. 
    - Time Complexity O(log(N))
    - Space Complexity O(1) 

* pop(self) 
    - removes the root element from the heap 
    - return: type Node, the root element 
    - if no elements exist return None 
    - Time Complexity O(log(N))
    - Space Complexity O(1) 

* is_empty(self)
    - return : type Bool 
* top(self)
    - return : type Node
    - return the root, in the case where that isn't possible return None

    


Application Problem 

* most_x_commons(vals, x):
vals: type List[string]
x: type int
- returns a set of strings
- Space Complexity O(N)
- Time Complexity O(Nlog(x)) 
- N == len(vals)
* Using any kind of sorting algorithm will result in a zero.
* in the case of ties (i.e. the elements have the same amount of repeatness)
 pick the element that comes first lexicographically

How long it took to complete
A list of any external resources that you used, especially websites (make sure to include the URLs) and which function(s) you used this information for.
 
Assignment Specifications
- No use of heapq module is permitted
- Only allowed container classes (or class methods) allowed are built in lists (specifically to store underlying heap class data) and the built in dictionary in the application problem.
- most_x_common MUST run faster then nlogn time, and use your heap class.
- you are guaranteed that x is always <= N (Where N is the number of elements)
- in the event of a tie on count within deciding which element to remove because the key is the same, pop the lower value.
- as always methods and attributes with a leading underscore should not be called outside of the class definition
- guarenteed that no duplicate nodes (meaning same key and value) will be called to be pushed into heap
- guarenteed that only keys of type int will be pushed
- All string methods are provided for debugging purposes and aren't used in testing in anyway.
